## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM


### What I learned

Learning SASS and how to combine it with BEM. It gets a bit confusing at times, but it helps in nice and organized code down the road. 

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

Learning how to use SASS. For now I have all in one file, but later down the road id like to start on spliting my scss in more files. Im realy like use of BEM. Even I get to final result I feel HTML is not as semantic as it should be.
